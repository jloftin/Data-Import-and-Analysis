# Data-Import-and-Analysis
Short intro to using the import tool in MATLAB
The Import Tool lets you preview and import data from spreadsheet files, delimited text files, and fixed-width text files. In MATLAB® Online™, you can also preview and import data from HDF5 files and netCDF files. You can interactively select the data to import and reuse the script or function that the tool generates to import other similar files.
